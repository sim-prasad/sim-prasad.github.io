          <div class="item  rp">
            An Internet meme is a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission.
            Memes describe any cultural idea or behaviour.
            Fashion, language, religion, sports—all of these are memes.
          </div>

          <div class="item  red">
          Genes determine an organism’s physical characteristics - the genes themselves are not thinking beings.
          Memes determine the behaviour of an organism - either taught to an organism) or learned through experience.
          </div>

          <div class="item  blue">
          The speed of transmission is no longer limited by the movement of individuals, and the form of the joke is preserved by a medium, not memory.
          </div>

          <div class="item  pink">
          Emoticons reference a previously existing source of meaning (human facial expressions) and therefore can be easily interpreted upon first encounter.

          Emoticons reference a previously existing source of meaning (human facial expressions) and therefore can be easily interpreted upon first encounter.
          </div>

          <div class="item  red">
          More than just re-creating face-to-face meaning in textual communication, emoticons also add the possibility of a new level of meaning—a level impossible without them.
          </div>

          <div class="item  blue">
            They underscore tone, introduce humour, and give us a quick way to bring personality into otherwise monochrome spaces - “emotional labour" - the commercialization of feelings that smooth our social interactions on a daily basis.
          </div>

          <div class="item  pink">
            “People fundamentally crave the ability to express the full range of human emotions.”   Unlike emojis — a static and limited set of images — GIFs can intersect with moments of pop culture that convey a far broader range of sentiments (and inside jokes).
          </div>

          <div class="item  rp">
          The passing meme successfully replicates itself in a new organism without the all-or-nothing cycle of life and death.
          </div>

          <div class="item  red">
          the use of emojis is damaging our ability to communicate and while this may be true for young children who are still learning how to properly communicate, it may not quite affect us adults in the same way.
          </div>

          <div class="item  blue">
            Without facial expressions, intonations, and general body language, we're left to interpret the neutrality, or lack thereof, in the intentions behind the words - people believe it helps them to be better understood, and to create more personal connections.
          </div>
