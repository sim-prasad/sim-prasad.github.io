<div class="header"> On Not Being Afraid of a Blank Slate </div>

<blockquote>
Creative director Piera Gelardi discusses her role at Refinery29, what can be learned from past failures, and always prioritizing your own creativity. I can relate since all the content used in the book is created by me, and starting fresh on a blank slate can be the most difficult part of design - just getting it started.
