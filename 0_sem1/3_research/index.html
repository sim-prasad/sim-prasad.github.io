    <h1> Digital Publishing Research  </h1>

<h3> IDEA 1 - Digitally Pubslihsing Archived Content from old Women's Weekly Magazines on Tumblr </h3>
    <p> I will be publishing selected content from the archived magazines on tumblr and see what other users repost around my content. As tumblr allows you to control the content you post on your tumblr pages and choose what you show on your page, I wanted to focus on the dashboard where the content isnt controlled. I will be screenshotting the contrast of content that shows up on the dashboard, and exploring whether the content works together or has no connection  </p>

<h3> IDEA 2 - Similar but Different </h3>
<p> In this experiment I will be using the same content and also the same platform but this time I will be publishing selected content from the archived magazines on my tumblr page, rather than focusing on the dashboard. As I mentioned previously, tumblr allows you to control the content you post on your tumblr pages and choose what you show on your page, I wanted to stick with the idea of creating my own tumblr page, however, I will be getting other people around me to repost content that they like. Anything and everything, whatever they like. This way I will still be doing what tumblr is made to do however, doing it in an uncontrolled manner, different to other usual pages. </p>
